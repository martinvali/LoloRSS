## Introduction

## Technologies Used

For this project, I decided to go with pure HTML, CSS and JS to make sure that I comply with the given instructions. Additionally, as itÂ´s a simple website, there is no need for a complex framework or library.

## Notes

When it comes to filtering articles, articles will be displayed unless all of its categories are unchecked in the filtering area. For example, if an article has 4 categories, the article will be displayed until all 4 categories are unchecked.

For real deployment, a bundler should be used to reduce redundant HTTPS requests for JS and CSS files.
